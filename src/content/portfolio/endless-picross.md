## Description
A picross puzzle, also known as a Nonogram, is a picture logic puzzle in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid. 

Typicially, this type of puzzle reveals a hidden image once completed. Instead, this version of the game is "endless" because each puzzle is randomly generated.

## Description
A web version of the popular Choose Our Future exhibit at the [UCAR/NCAR Mesa Lab Visitor Center](https://scied.ucar.edu/visit) in Boulder, Colorado, USA. Developed for my senior capstone alongside 6 other developers and a project sponsor.

## The exhibit
Every day, you make hundreds of choices which can impact climate change by changing the amount of greenhouse gases you emit, either directly (e.g. by burning fossil fuels in your house or car), or indirectly (e.g. having things made for you, or transported around for you).

In the Choose Our Future exhibit at NCAR, you can see how those choices add up to make your carbon footprint, and what the effect would be on the climate if everybody acted the same way as you in the future.

Almost a year ago, I built [kino.wtf](https://www.kino.wtf) as a collection of daily movie guessing games inspired by [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). At the time, I used [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) because I wanted to try something new and different from React. The experiment was fun and the framework worked well, but as the project evolved, I found myself missing React's mature ecosystem and familiar patterns.

## Why the migration?
When I first built kino.wtf, trying out Solid.js seemed like a great opportunity to learn a new framework. And it was! Solid is fast, elegant, and has some really interesting reactivity patterns. 

But over time, I ran into a few challenges:
- __Ecosystem maturity.__ While Solid has a growing community, React's ecosystem is simply massive. Finding solutions to problems, third-party libraries, and community resources was often easier with React.
- __Development velocity.__ Most of my other projects use React, and context-switching between Solid's reactive primitives and React's hooks was slowing me down. Consolidating on a single framework meant I could move faster.
- __Future maintenance.__ As I continue to add features to kino.wtf, having the project in React makes it easier to bring in contributors who are already familiar with the framework.

The decision wasn't a knock against Solid — it's a great framework. But for this project, React simply made more practical sense.

## What changed under the hood
The migration involved more than just swapping out framework code. Here's what got updated:

- __Framework:__ Migrated from Solid.js to React with TypeScript.
- __Styling:__ Upgraded to Tailwind CSS 4 and integrated DaisyUI for component theming.
- __State management:__ Converted Solid's signals and stores to React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext).
- __Build tooling:__ Kept Vite but updated configuration for React's JSX transform.
- __Component patterns:__ Rewrote components to use React's declarative patterns.
- __Curated Games:__ The daily/weekly games of movies, actors, and directors is now hand-curated by me to have less obscure titles or people.
- __Game fetching:__ Games for all modes are now fetched and cast to a reusable _Game_ object that makes it easy to add new game modes in the future. The script I created to fetch these objects ensures hints are ordered by popularity and is able to fetch enough hints/trivia/images for a full game with no missing data. 

The core game logic and the daily puzzle system remained largely the same, but the way state flows through the application is now more aligned with React's unidirectional data flow.

## What stayed the same
From a player's perspective, nothing major changed. The games work exactly as before (but added a new gamemode: _Directors_):

- Six attempts per game with progressive hints.
- 3 trivia facts per game that are revealed every other hint. 
- Stats tracking games played, games won, current streak and max streak. 
- Shareable results.
- Stats are still saved to local browser storage but I have plans to add a sign in feature to save stats between devices/browsers.

## Technical details
For those interested in the technical implementation, the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kaischuygon/kino.wtf). The latest release [(v2)](https://github.com/kaischuygon/kino.wtf/releases/tag/v2-React) includes the full React migration.

### Some interesting implementation details:

- Daily puzzles are generated deterministically based on the current date, so no backend is needed.
- Game state persists in localStorage to track streaks and stats.
- The app uses the [TMDb API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/getting-started) for movie metadata and imagery. For more information regarding how I fetch game data, see the python script in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kaischuygon/kino.wtf).
- Development builds include a handy `window.__simulateNextBoundary()` helper for testing new daily puzzles without waiting for midnight.

## Moving forward
The React migration gives me a solid foundation to add new features I've been thinking about — more game modes, better mobile experience and cross-device stats. The improved developer experience means I can iterate faster and refresh games more quickly.

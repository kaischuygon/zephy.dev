As my Mobile App Development course is moving on from Swift and iOS development to Kotlin and Android development, we were asked to read _Principles of Mobile App Design: Engage Users and Drive Conversions_ by Jenny Gove, the UX Research Lead at Google. The following principles stood out to me when reading.

## Priciple 4: Make it easy to manually change location.
**Summary**: There are times when users need to find a store that's not located nearby. Make manual entry of location and straightforward.

**Good Example**: The transportation app [_Transit_](https://transitapp.com/) lets you drag anywhere on the map to change your location to see transit lines at whatever location you want quickly. I also allows you to manually enter an address.

## Priciple 19: Match the keyboard with the required text inputs. 
**Summary**: App users appreciate apps that provide an appropriate keyboard for text entry. 

**Good Example**: When creating a new contact in iOS's _Contacts_ app, the keyboard for fields differ. The phone number entry is a phone keypad, the email keyboard includes an @ symbol next to the space bar, and the URL keyboard includes no space and instead has ., / and .com shortcuts.

## Principle 24: Let the user control the level of zoom.
**Summary**: Users want to be able to control the level of zoom when they view an image. They can become frustrated by apps that zoom in at a preedetermined magnification level. In particular, wee see instances of this when the zoomed-in view forces the user to look at a specific part of the item or takes the image partially off-screen. Put users in control by allowing them to zoom in as they prefer.

**Bad example**: Instagram does not allow users to have full zoom control. You can pinch in a bit but as soon as you let go the image snaps back to its original zoom level.

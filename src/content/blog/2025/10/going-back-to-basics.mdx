I. Introduction

Hook: What prompted the decision to simplify
Brief context: Where your site was before vs. where it's going
Thesis: Why "back to basics" matters for you (and potentially readers)

I've remade my portfolio a few times. I first made my site when the extent of my web development knowledge included HTML/CSS and a little javascript. The site had a colorful background, funky adobe illustrator graphics I made myself and a simple light/dark mode toggle.

When I got further along my software career, I found portfolios that had blog posts, leveraged external javascript libraries for experiences like 3D models, involved CSS animations and even an imitation windows 98 desktop environment. I tried my hand at remaking these experiences myself and had a blast, but I knew it wasn't the direction I wanted my personal site to go.

The longevity in adhering to standard in web development is something I have found more and more intriguing as I have been working in the industry. There's a lot of code out there that attempts to reinvent a wheel that people more experienced than me has decided should be the standard for the web. I value projects like MDN or w3 because it considers factors a lot of developers ignore, such as assessibility or semantic HTML. These are foundational to the web.

II. The Problem: What Had Become Too Complex

Specific pain points you experienced
What you realized wasn't serving your goals
The moment or catalyst that sparked the change

I've experimented with a lot of different javascript frameworks, CSS integrations and component libraries. The biggest painpoint I found with this was backwards compatibility, hard to modify components and more. 



III. Defining "Back to Basics" for Your Site

What "basics" means in your context
Your core principles or priorities
What you're keeping vs. removing

Back to basics for me does not mean just remaking my site in pure HTML/CSS. There is a big advantage to using javascript frameworks like React or Angular. Projects like tailwind provide reusable, unthemed CSS with variables that allow speedy development while not taking over your project. Tools like Astro provide easy to use features like content collections, component islands and integrations for things like SEO and content authoring, and well-documented methods for a lot of functionality including CI/CD. 

I knew that in remaking my portfolio I didn't want to ignore all of these benefits but wanted to strip things down in terms of the libraries, frameworks and integrations I used. That's why my site is built solely using Astro and tailwind, with some React islands for reactivity when needed. 

IV. The Process of Simplification

Steps you took or are taking
Challenges encountered along the way
Decisions you had to make (and how you made them)


V. What Changed (Concrete Examples)

Technical changes (if applicable)
Design/UX changes
Content strategy shifts
Tools or features you eliminated

I took away DaisyUI, a tailwind-based UI component library.

I removed most global styles, instead opting for breaking down components as modular as possible and having inline styles using tailwind. 

VI. Early Results or Observations

How it feels different
Unexpected benefits or challenges
What you're learning

The codebase is a lot easier to navigate now, there are little to no nested components and most props are now optional. 

VII. Lessons or Takeaways

Insights for others considering similar changes
What you'd do differently
Broader reflections on simplicity vs. complexity

VIII. Conclusion

Where you go from here
Invitation for reader reflection or action
Final thought on the value of returning to basics

I keep noticing is that the best experiences I have on these sites and the web in general is simplicity.

import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components";

Below is an example post demonstrating many MDX features supported by this project configuration. It is marked as draft 
so as to now appear in the blogpost list when deployed.

This file demonstrates an MDX post that matches the `blog` collection schema in `content.config.ts`.

## 1. Images and static assets

You can reference images that live in `src/assets/images`, in the `public/` folder or external.

Inline image with alt text and a title: ![alt text](https://picsum.photos/100/100 "Title")

## 2. Inline code and fenced code blocks

Inline code looks like `const answer = 42;` and is great for short snippets.

```js
// A small JavaScript example
function greet(name) {
	return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('Astro'));
```

```tsx
// You can include JSX/TSX too
import React from 'react';

export default function Demo() {
	return <button onClick={() => alert('Clicked')}>Click me</button>;
}
```

## 5. use components in markup
HTML markup and custom components can be added to this mdx file to render if imported. 

This:
```mdx
import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components";

<div class="flex gap-2 text-4xl">
    <Icon name="wind" />
    <Icon name="lineicons:ticket-1" class="fill-accent-500" />
</div>
```

Renders this: 
<div class="flex gap-2 text-4xl">
    <Icon name="wind" />
    <Icon name="lineicons:ticket-1" class="text-accent-500" />
</div>

## 6. Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote text. Footnotes are useful for asides.

## 7. Accessibility and SEO tips

- Always provide `alt` attributes for images.
- Use semantic headings (H1–H6) in order.
- Keep frontmatter `description` short (150-160 chars) for meta descriptions.
